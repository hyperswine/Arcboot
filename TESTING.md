# Testing Arcboot

I dunno rn tbh. It is quite close to bare metal. It is bare metal without std. A custom test harness is possible to use with a `arcutils` flasher and QEMU runner.

Maybe `arcutils test --arcboot` to actually build a QEMU-test config/debug build. And flash it onto a vhd to then run QEMU.
