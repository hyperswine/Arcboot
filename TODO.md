# TODO

- something isnt working, idk what. Im guessing its something to do with the structure cause the non setup.S also seems to fail
- maybe ENTRY(_setup) is wrong somehow or IDK. Its just not creating the ELF image properly from the physical addresses and assembly Im giving it
- new feature: allow an arcboot kernel to be completely writable in rust using arcboot export functions
